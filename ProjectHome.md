JKE is a dead project and has been forked into t3's opensaber modification. We strongly recommend that you switch JKE servers to opensaber and commit fixes there instead. Thanks!

~~JK Enhanced is a new serverside mod for Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. It's intended to be used for serious JKA communities as an educative tool for learning the way JKA servers work (gameplay-wise) without having to go too far from basejka. As such, it unlocks certain cheat-protected settings, allows for more customization of the combat system, and adds common additions that other popular mods have.~~


Currently, there is no work being done on the mod. If anyone wants to contribute, please join in on the #terminative3 IRC channel (irc.quakenet.org) and leave a message.

Things to be done (the mod is pretty well finished):

- Add a flipkick Cvar (for full force)

- Patch some security holes

- Add full-force duel option

- (Non-critical) Find a way to make saber hit detection more like vanilla basejka.

- (Non-critical) Fix some weapon issues such as the rocket glitch.



Servers previously donated by DJ\_Sith at the JA. (Thanks for putting up with us!)

_This project has **nothing** to do with the JK1/MotS mod as shown here: http://www.jkhub.net/project/show.php?projid=242__
