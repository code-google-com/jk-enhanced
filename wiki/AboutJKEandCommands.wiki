= Jedi Knight Enhanced =

JK Enhanced (JKE) aims to be a stable multiplayer server choice for Jedi Academy.

It adds some useful things to the default game such as Black Names, multiple duels and others while trying to keep the gameplay identical to basejka. 

If players so desire, they are free and able to alter gameplay-changing cvars that have been added, but unlike other mods they are disabled by default.

JKE was influenced by Jedi Academy Empire (JAE) Mod, but does have some added content that can potentially make the gameplay completely different from basejka.
